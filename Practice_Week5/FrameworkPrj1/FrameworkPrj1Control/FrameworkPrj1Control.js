                Attribute philosophy
                --------------------
                - Local variables are not set in the class definition, so they have the value 'undefined'.
                - During compilation, the Framework sets the value that is specified in the HTML or in the theme (possibly 'null') via normal setters.
                - Because of the "changed detection" in the setter, the value is only processed once during compilation.
                - Attention: If we have a Server Binding on an Attribute, the setter will be called once with null to initialize and later with the correct value.
